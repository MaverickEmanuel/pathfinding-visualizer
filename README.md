# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer! This website allows you to choose a pathfinding algorithm and visually see how it finds its way from a start node to an end node.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of pathfinding algorithms.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the algorithm in action as it finds the path.
- **Customizable Grid**: Set your own start and end nodes, and add obstacles to see how the algorithm handles them.

## Available Algorithms

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from the start node to the end node.
- **A\***: A heuristic-based algorithm that optimizes pathfinding.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Greedy Best-First Search**: Prioritizes nodes that are closest to the end node.

## How to Use

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. **Set Start and End Nodes**: Click on the grid to set the start node (green) and end node (red).
3. **Add Obstacles**: Click on the grid to add obstacles (black squares) that the algorithm must navigate around.
4. **Visualize the Path**: Click the "Visualize" button to see the algorithm in action.
5. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start over.
